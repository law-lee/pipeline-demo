# Five simple programs
In this chapter, we will build five small programs that we will combine at the end. The key
features of the programs are as follows:
- Sprinkle: This program will add some web-friendly sprinkle words to increase
the chances of finding the available domain names.
- Domainify: This program will ensure words are acceptable for a domain name
by removing unacceptable characters. Once this is done, it will replace spaces
with hyphens and add an appropriate top-level domain (such as .com and .net)
to the end.
- Coolify: This program will change a boring old normal word to Web 2.0 by
  fiddling around with vowels.
- Synonyms: This pro will use a third-party API to find synonyms.
- Available: This gram will use a third-party API to find synonyms. Available: This
  program will check to see whether the domain is available or not using an
  appropriate WHOIS server.
